# Goblin Assistant

A minimal demo repository to house the Goblin Assistant — a small CLI and library scaffold designed to hold experiments for local AI agents and helpers.

This repository is a demo scaffold; later phases may add more features, such as a web UI, example agents, or Azure Functions.

## What's inside

- `src/` - TypeScript source files
- `README.md` - This file
- `package.json` - NPM scripts for building, running, and testing
- `LICENSE` - MIT License

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```bash
# From the repo root
cd goblin-assistant
pnpm install   # or npm install
```

Run the demo CLI:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Contributing

This is intentionally small and simple. Add features incrementally. Please run tests and keep TypeScript strict.
